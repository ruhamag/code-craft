            <p>
              I am an Information Science student at Addis Ababa University with a strong academic foundation and a passion for crafting digital experiences.
               My focus is on frontend development and UI/UX design, where I blend technical skills with creative problem-solving to build intuitive and 
               engaging user interfaces. I am also deeply interested in the strategic world of digital marketing, understanding how design and code work 
               together to connect with audiences and drive growth. Eager to apply my growing expertise and collaborative spirit, I am seeking opportunities to
                contribute to innovative projects that sit at the intersection of design, development, and marketing.
